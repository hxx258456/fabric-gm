//TODO skeleton

// Chain implements a component that allows the orderer to follow a specific channel when is not a cluster member,
// that is, be a "follower" of the cluster. This means that the current orderer is not a member of the consenters set
// of the channel, and is only pulling blocks from other orderers.
//
// The follower is inspecting config blocks as they are pulled and if it discovers that it was introduced into the
// consenters set, it will trigger the creation of a regular etcdraft.Chain, that is, turn into a "member" of the
// cluster.
//
// The follower is started in one of two ways: 1) following an API Join request with a join-block that does not include
// the orderer in its conseters set, or 2) when the orderer was a cluster member and was removed from the consenters
// set.
//
// The follower is in status "onboarding" when it pulls blocks below the join-block number, or "active" when it
// pulls blocks equal or above the join-block number.
